      Many edge cases and novelty for devs: 
      - There's so many ways use this tech and so many cases and flows that you have
        to consider 
      - New login pattern: many users haven't used their biometric unlock for web services yet and need to be educated 
      - Cross-device & cross-platform questions: different UX on different browsers and devices need to be considered 
      - Lack of support by auth providers and tech stack: many existing authentication providers have no easy option to
        enable passkeys for most prevalent tech stacks
